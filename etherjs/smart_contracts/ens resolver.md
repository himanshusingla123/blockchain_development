Sure, let's break down the provided information about the `EnsResolver` class and related types and classes:

### Types

- **AvatarLinkageType**: Enumerates the types of data found during a step during avatar resolution.
- **AvatarLinkage**: Represents an individual record for each step during avatar resolution, including the type of linkage and its value.
- **AvatarResult**: Provides details of each completed step during avatar resolution, including the linkages and the resolved avatar URL.

### Classes

#### BasicMulticoinProviderPlugin

- **Purpose**: Provides services for common coin types without requiring additional libraries to encode or decode.
- **Inheritance**: Inherits from `MulticoinProviderPlugin` and `AbstractProviderPlugin`.
- **Constructor**: `new BasicMulticoinProviderPlugin()`: Creates a new instance of `BasicMulticoinProviderPlugin`.

#### EnsResolver

- **Purpose**: Represents a connected object to a resolved ENS name resolver, used to query additional details.
- **Properties**:
  - `address`: The address of the resolver.
  - `name`: The name this resolver was resolved against.
  - `provider`: The connected provider.
- **Constructor**: `new EnsResolver(provider: AbstractProvider, address: string, name: string)`: Creates a new instance of `EnsResolver`.
- **Methods**:
  - `_getAvatar()`: Resolves to an `AvatarResult` object containing details of each step and the value it was working from during avatar resolution.
  - `getAddress(coinType?: number)`: Resolves to the address for the specified coinType or null if not configured.
  - `getAvatar()`: Resolves to the avatar URL or null if unconfigured or incorrectly configured.
  - `getContentHash()`: Resolves to the content-hash or null if unconfigured.
  - `getText(key: string)`: Resolves to the EIP-634 text record for the specified key or null if unconfigured.
  - `supportsWildcard()`: Resolves to true if the resolver supports wildcard resolution.
- **Static Methods**:
  - `fromName(provider: AbstractProvider, name: string)`: Resolves to the ENS resolver for the specified name using the provided provider or null if unconfigured.
  - `getEnsAddress(provider: Provider)`: Resolves to the ENS resolver's address using the provided provider.

### Abstract Classes

#### MulticoinProviderPlugin

- **Purpose**: Provides a superclass for processing multicoin address types.
- **Inheritance**: Inherits from `AbstractProviderPlugin`.
- **Properties**:
  - `name`: Read-only property representing the name of the plugin.
- **Constructor**: `new MulticoinProviderPlugin(name: string)`: Creates a new instance of `MulticoinProviderPlugin` for the specified name.
- **Methods**:
  - `decodeAddress(coinType: number, data: BytesLike)`: Resolves to the decoded data for the specified coinType.
  - `encodeAddress(coinType: number, address: string)`: Resolves to the encoded address for the specified coinType.
  - `supportsCoinType(coinType: number)`: Returns true if the coinType is supported by this plugin.

These classes and types provide a framework for working with ENS resolvers, querying additional details, and processing multicoin address types in a flexible and extensible manner.
